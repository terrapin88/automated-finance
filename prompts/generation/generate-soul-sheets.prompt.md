Given profiles/org_profile.yaml, tailor the Soul Sheets in /soul-sheets.

## Instructions
- Keep each agent generic and portable.
- Inject org-specific nouns only where helpful (systems, custodians, cadences, thresholds).
- Populate:
  - Tooling hooks (systems, folders)
  - Cadences (close schedule, reporting cadence)
  - Escalation triggers (materiality, thresholds)
- Do not create new agents unless there is an obvious missing lane.
- Preserve the "Output envelope" section verbatim in every Soul Sheet.

## Output
- Provide updated markdown for each Soul Sheet, as separate blocks titled by filename.
